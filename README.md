<h1>MAP-RADAR-APP</h1>
<p>
  I've developed a web application that serves as an aircraft tracking radar system. Leveraging APIs, the platform provides comprehensive details such as aircraft tail numbers, airline names, aircraft models, departure and arrival airports, among other information. Users can track aircraft in real-time and access detailed information by clicking on aircraft images, including high-resolution photos.

This project was built using React-Toolkit-Thunk, ensuring a seamless user experience and efficient state management. Whether you're an aviation enthusiast, a traveler wanting to monitor your flight, or simply curious about aircraft movements, this application offers an intuitive interface to explore real-time air traffic data. Explore the skies like never before with our aircraft tracking radar system!
